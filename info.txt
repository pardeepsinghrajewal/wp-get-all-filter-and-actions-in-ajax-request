We gernaly need to find which filters or actions are running when a specific task or code is running using Ajax. This smallÂ script can save a day!

We need to add code into the plugin.php file.

File Path : /wp-includes/plugin.php

Funtion names : 

1) function add_filter( $hook_name, ... ) 

2) function add_action( $hook_name, ... ) 

3) function do_action( $hook_name, ... ) 

4) function apply_filters( $hook_name, ... ) 


Add code in the staring of these functions definitions. 

I have added the plugin.php example too!
